# Polite Tasks #

I am forgetful. To solve this problem, I use a todo list as a reminder of the
projects that lie ahead of me. This is a tried and true method, but there is one
problem. I am also a single tasker. I like to focus on one thing and get that done
before moving to the next thing. The problem with a todo list is that it is a list.
I can see what I have to do but I also see what I will have to do. If one of those
tasks seems more interesting, I might move onto that. As you can see, this could
be a problem.

Polite Tasks solves that by only displaying one task at a time. Once that task is
complete, it will archive it and show you the next task.

The plans are:

1. create a command line interface that uses a text file for the todo list.
2. switch this to a web app where the user can load text files as the input
3. make it so the web app has accounts so people, other than me, can use the app
4. post it to hacker news
5. get bought out by a large company
6. buy a Ferrari and a wood shop
7. learn how to make fine furnature
8. keep track of my furnature projects using Polite Tasks

Those plans (oh boy, it's a list) are somewhat ambitious, but I'd be satisfied
completing the first three.

## Files ##
**pt_cli.py** - This is the file for the command line interface. It reads a file
named tasks.todo (or asks for the file) and displays the command line interface.

## Installation ##
Download the file and run it in a directory containing your tasks.todo file.
It requires Python 2.7+.
